# âš½  Football Players Pose Tracking


FIFA World Cup 2022 has motivated me to revisit this idea. This time I used a combination of [YOLOv5](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5) and [ByteTrack](https://github.com/ifzhang/ByteTrack) to track football players on the field. This blog post accompanies the Roboflow video where I talk through how to track players on a football field.

I was watching a FIFA 2022 World Cup match the other day, and one of the things that caught my eye was VAR - Video Assistant Referee, or to be more precise, the part of it responsible for analyzing whether a player was on the offside. I did a little [research](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WycjDx6giVE) and found that the system performs pose estimation on multiple cameras at once. I decided to check how difficult it would be to reproduce it at home using two cameras and [YOLOv7](https://github.com/WongKinYiu/yolov7).
