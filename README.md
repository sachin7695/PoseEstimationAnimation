I have long been fascinated by the use of Computer Vision in sports. After all, it is a combination of two things I love. Almost three years ago, I wrote a post on my personal blog in which I triedâ€Šâ€”â€Šat that time, still using YOLOv3â€Šâ€”â€Što [detect and classify basketball players on the court](https://towardsdatascience.com/chess-rolls-or-basketball-lets-create-a-custom-object-detection-model-ef53028eac7d).

FIFA World Cup 2022 has motivated me to revisit this idea. This time I used a combination of [YOLOv5](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5) and [ByteTrack](https://github.com/ifzhang/ByteTrack) to track football players on the field. This blog post accompanies the Roboflow video where I talk through how to track players on a football field.

I was watching a FIFA 2022 World Cup match the other day, and one of the things that caught my eye was VAR - Video Assistant Referee, or to be more precise, the part of it responsible for analyzing whether a player was on the offside. I did a little [research](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WycjDx6giVE) and found that the system performs pose estimation on multiple cameras at once. I decided to check how difficult it would be to reproduce it at home using two cameras and [YOLOv7](https://github.com/WongKinYiu/yolov7).

# ðŸ‘• Assigning Football Players to Teams by Uniform Color with GPT-4V

This project explores the use of [GPT-4V](https://openai.com/research/gpt-4v-system-card) in sports analytics, specifically in the context of football. Its primary aim was to evaluate whether GPT-4V could effectively distinguish and assign players to teams based on the color of their uniforms. This was achieved through the implementation of several advanced vision prompting techniques.
